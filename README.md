Plant Seedling Classification
Overview
This project aims to classify different species of plants at the seedling stage using image recognition techniques. Early identification of plant species can significantly improve agricultural practices by aiding in efficient crop management and invasive species detection.

Using deep learning and computer vision, this project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify 12 plant species. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of seedling images, employing data preprocessing, augmentation, and a CNN-based architecture to achieve high accuracy in predicting plant species.

Dataset
The Plant Seedlings Dataset from Kaggle is used for training and testing the model. It contains labeled images of seedlings across 12 species:

Black-grass
Charlock
Cleavers
Common Chickweed
Common Wheat
Fat Hen
Loose Silky-bent
Maize
Scentless Mayweed
Shepherdâ€™s Purse
Small-flowered Cranesbill
Sugar Beet
